--- Explanation for problem_4.py (is_user_in_group) ---

To find the given user is in the Group  (and all sub groups beneath it) 
in the Active Directory, Recursion is used.

Recursion avoids repetition of code and its fast.

Time complexity for problem_4 solution is O(n) 
where n is the number of groups in the Active Directory

Space complexity of recursive algorithm is proportional to maximum depth of recursion tree generated
Hence, space complexity of this solution is O(nm) 
where n is the total number of Groups in the Active Directory
and m is the maximum depth of recursion tree
