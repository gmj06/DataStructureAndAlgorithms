--- Explanation for problem_1.py (LRU_Cache) ---

With Doubly-Linked List, insertion and deletion time complexity is O(1) whereas search in the list is O(n) 
where n is the number of nodes in the list

Time complexity of this solution is O(n) where n is the capacity with which LRU_Cache object is created
Space complexity of this solution is O(n) where n is the capacity with which LRU_Cache object is created
