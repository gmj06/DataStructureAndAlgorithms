--- Explanation for problem_6.py (Linked Lists Union and Intersection) ---

Finding the Union and Intersection of two Singly-Linked List of nodes m and n respectively, 
the time complexity (worst case) is O(mn)

Hence, time complexity for problem_6 solution is O(mn)
where m is the total number of nodes in Linked List 1 
and n is the total number of nodes in Linked List 2

Space complexity for problem_6 solution is also O(mn)
where m is the total number of nodes in Linked List 1 
and n is the total number of nodes in Linked List 2
