--- Explanation for problem_2.py (find_files) ---

Used Recusion to finding all files under a directory (and all directories beneath it)
with the suffix (if provided else all the files will be returned).

Recursion avoids repetition of code and its fast.

Time complexity of this solution is O(n) where n is the total number of files/directories in the given path

Space complexity of recursive algorithm is proportional to maximum depth of recursion tree generated
Hence, space complexity of this solution is O(nm) 
where n is the total number of files/directories in the given path
and m is the maximum depth of recursion tree
