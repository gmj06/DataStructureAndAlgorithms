--- Explanation for problem_1.py (LRU_Cache) ---

Using OrderedDict(), we can achieve the time complexicity of O(1).
This datastructure remembers the insertion order. 
When the capacity is full, we can easily remove the least recently used cache using popitem(last = False).
As (last = False) gives us FIFO order, so we can remove the least recently used cache.

Time complexity of this solution is O(1)
