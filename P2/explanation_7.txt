--- Explanation for problem_7.py (HTTPRouter using a Trie) ---

Using Trie datastructure, insertion and search is faster. 
But, the downside is it takes huge memory for storing the characters.

Time complexity for this solution using Trie is O(l) 
where l is the length of the path inserting/searching

Space complexity for this solution is O(w*n) 
where w is the number of path in the Trie and 
n is average length of the path in the Trie
