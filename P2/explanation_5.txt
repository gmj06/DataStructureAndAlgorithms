--- Explanation for problem_5.py (Autocomplete with Tries) ---

Using Trie datastructure, insertion and search is faster. 
But, the downside is it takes huge memory for storing the characters.

Time complexity for this solution using Trie is O(l) 
where l is the length of the word inserting/searching

Space complexity for this solution is O(w*n) 
where w is the number of words in the Trie and 
n is average length of the word in the Trie
