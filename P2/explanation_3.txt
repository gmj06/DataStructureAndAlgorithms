--- Explanation for problem_3.py (Rearrange Array Elements) ---

The given array is sorted by converting to max-heap by using heapify (or by heapsort algorithm)
and then identified two numbers with maximum sum by looping through the sorted array.

Time complexity for heapsort is O(nlog(n))
Time complexity for identifying the two numbers with maximum sum is O(n)
Hence, Time complexity for this solution is O(nlog(n))

Space complexity for heapsort is O(1).
Space complexity for identifying the two numbers with maximum sum is O(n)
Hence, Time complexity for this solution is O(n)
