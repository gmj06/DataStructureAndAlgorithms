--- Explanation for problem_2.py (Search in a Rotated Sorted Array) ---

Binary Search algorithm is used to search for a given number in the rotated sorted array.

Time complexity for this solution is O(log(n)) where n is the length of the given array
Space complexity for Binary search is O(1) which is constant
But, as this is a rotated sorted array, we have to identify the pivot.
Hence, Space complexity for this solution is O(n) where n is the length of the given array
