--- Explanation for problem_4.py (Dutch National Flag Problem) ---

Sort an array consisting of only 0,1, and 2 in a single traversal can be
achieved using Three-Way-Partition. 

Time complexity for this solution is O(n) 
where n is the number of array elements 

Space complexity for this solution is O(n) 
where n is the number of array elements
